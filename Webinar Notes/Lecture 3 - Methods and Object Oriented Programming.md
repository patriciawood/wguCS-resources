# Lecture 3: Methods and Object Oriented Programming
- Overview
	- Understand methods
	- Access modigies
	- Object-Oriented
	- Abstract Class
	- Casting
	- Static/Instant casters
- Method
	- Basically a function. Wraps code in container.
	- Structure
		- Access modified
		- Optional specifier
		- Method name
		- Parameters
		- called Method Declaration
	- Once declared, can be called.
	- Access Modifer
		- public
			- member used in any class
		- private
			- member accessed directly by same class
		- protected
			- classes in same package
		- Default
	- Optional Specifier
		- static
			- member belongs to class.
			- Shared by other objects
		- abstract
			- Cannot create object from class.
		- final
			- constant variable
	- Return type
		- primitive or reference value when called.
		- void - does not return value
		- allows data transfer.
	- Method Naming
		- Use camelCasing or underscores.
		- ==Use *verb-noun* format
			- calculateNet. Action and thing
	- Parameters
		- declared in method header (inside parenthesis obvi.)
		- ==note: create an exclaidraw visual of different method parts
		- num vals passed must match parameters declared.
	- Arguments
		- value passed into method when called. 
- Constructors and Objects
	- constructors have no return type.
	- default constructor
		- created by java if not defined. Assigns default values to fields.
		- Writing your own overwrites it
- object-oriented principles
	- two princliples needed
	- Encapsulation
		- protects/hides data logic from program (like a safe)
		- *private* access modifier. 
		- variables Can only be accesssed via getters and setters.
		- fields private most of the time. 
	- Inheritance
		- One or more classes to inherit (subclasses) public or protected members from another class (super class).
		- Does not work in reverse.
		- Use ```extend``` keyword.
		- How look UML
			- Arrows 
				- ![[Pasted image 20230119140258.png]]
			- Subclasses point to Superclass.
			- Superclass is generic.
			- Methods in Animal class can be called in Dog and Cat classes. (setters and getters in this case.)
		- Point: Reduces redundancy.
	- Exercise: Continue [Animal Application](C:\Users\pdugge1\IdeaProjects\PDApplicationMain)
		- Created Setters and Getters
		- included ```extends``` to have Dog/Cat subclasses inherit from Animal superclass.

- Super() Command
	- allows subclass to call constructor in superclass.
	- must be called in subclass with matching arguments.
	- must be first statement in subclass constructor.
- Exercise 2: Super() Command
	- Created constructor in Animal superclass to override default constructor.
	- ![[Pasted image 20230119141845.png]]
		- Super() is highlighted.
	- Added ``Super()`` to Dog and Cat subclassess.
	- In Main, change the new Dog and Cat objects and delete the setters.
